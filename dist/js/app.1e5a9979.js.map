É um convite para suspender minha idade e implodir as travas que o peso do automatismo cravou no meu corpo. Aventura muito prazerosa porque a conquista de maior equilíbrio, tônus, agilidade e flexibilidade traz uma consciência inusitada. E então já não sabemos se o corpo anima a alma ou o contrário.
